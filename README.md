# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers-Project-

This project investigates the hypothesis that left-handed individuals experience
early death by exploring age distribution data. The aim is to determine if a
difference in the average age at death can be attributed to the changing rates of
left-handedness over time, thereby challenging the claim of premature mortality
among left-handers. The analysis leverages the Pandas library and Bayesian
statistics to assess the probability of being a particular age at death based on one's
reported hand preference, whether left-handed or right-handed. The findings from
this study provide insights into the relationship between handedness and age at
death and shed light on the accuracy of the early death assertion for left-handed
individuals.
